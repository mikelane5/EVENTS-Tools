# **EVENTS Tools**  

Event Tools helps you add common **Practice Sections** to your Reaper charts with the click of a button. You can also add text events like **[music_start]**, **[music_end]**, **[end]**, or any Crowd Clapping event too!

**<ins>All buttons create markers or text events at the current play head position</ins>**.

This project is a fork of EVENT Tools (https://github.com/RaiderGG/EVENTS-Tools).

## **Requirements**  
Event Tools requires **ReaImGui**. You can install it via **ReaPack** (https://reapack.com/).

## Adding Practice Section Markers
Practice section buttons are arranged in a logical order. Position the playhead where you want to create a marker and then click a practice section button. A color coded marker is created and the button changes color to match the marker. This gives you a visual map to refer to so that you know which markers you have already placed.

## Convert Practice Section Markers to EVENTS Track Text Eevenst

When you have created all your practice section markers, click the "Copy Markers to EVENTS Track" button. This will convert your markers to text events in the EVENTS Track. Markers are converted to the proper **[prc_(section)]** format.
